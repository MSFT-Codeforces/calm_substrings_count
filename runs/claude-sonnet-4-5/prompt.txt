You are an expert competitive programmer. 
You will be provided with a problem statement, first analyze the problem, then provide your solution in C++. 
Consider edge cases, time complexity, and space complexity. 
Make sure your solution handles all constraints mentioned in the problem. 
Your final solution should be a complete, compilable C++ program in a cpp codeblock.

**Calm Substrings Count**

You are given a string $s$ of length $n$ consisting of lowercase English letters. A substring (contiguous segment) of length $m$ is called **calm** if no letter occurs in it **strictly more** than $\frac{m}{2}$ times.

Formally, a substring $t$ of length $m$ is calm if for every letter $x$:
$$
\text{freq}_t(x) \le \frac{m}{2}.
$$

Count the number of calm substrings of $s$.

**Input Format:-**

- The first line contains an integer $n$ $(1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5)$.
- The second line contains a string $s$ of length $n$, consisting of lowercase Latin letters.

**Output Format:-**

Print one integer — the number of calm substrings.

**Constraints:-**

- $1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$
- $s$ contains only lowercase English letters

**Examples:-**
- **Input:**
```
